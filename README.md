# minimum-time-in-mess
# Work out and create generator for the problem discussed in class (given entry rate, service rate and eating time). 
Simulate by creating a generator by assuming the 3 PDF that you have.
The project involves the analysis of the minimum time spent in a mess by a person.
It uses various statistical techniques and libraries such as scipy.stats, matplotlib, numpy, and pandas to plot and analyze different aspects of the data.
The project includes the analysis of three different factors affecting the minimum time spent in the mess, which are entry rate, service rate, and eating time, and combines them to calculate the overall minimum time spent in the mess using mathematical equations.
