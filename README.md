Project Title
"Minimum Time Spent in Mess" Analysis

Description
This project involves the analysis of the minimum time spent in a mess by a person. The project uses various statistical techniques and libraries such as scipy.stats, matplotlib, numpy, and pandas to plot and analyze different aspects of the data.

Objectives
Work out and create a generator for the problem discussed in class (given entry rate, service rate, and eating time).
Simulate by creating a generator by assuming the 3 PDFs that you have.
Analyze the three different factors affecting the minimum time spent in the mess, which are entry rate, service rate, and eating time.
Combine the factors to calculate the overall minimum time spent in the mess using mathematical equations.
Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Scipy.stats
Matplotlib
Numpy
Pandas
Results
The project successfully analyzed the three factors affecting the minimum time spent in the mess and combined them to calculate the overall minimum time spent using mathematical equations. The results were visualized using different plots and charts.

Conclusion
The analysis of the minimum time spent in a mess can help in improving the mess facilities and services to reduce the time spent by a person in the mess. This project provides a framework for conducting such analyses and can be applied to other similar scenarios.
