# Minimum Time Spent in Mess Analysis Project

This project involves the analysis of the minimum time spent in a mess by a person. It includes the analysis of three different factors affecting the minimum time spent in the mess: 

- Entry rate
- Service rate
- Eating time

These factors are combined to calculate the overall minimum time spent in the mess using mathematical equations.

The project uses various statistical techniques and libraries such as **scipy.stats**, **matplotlib**, **numpy**, and **pandas** to plot and analyze different aspects of the data.

To simulate the problem, a generator is created by assuming the three PDFs that were discussed in class: entry rate, service rate, and eating time.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

- To analyze and visualize the minimum time spent in a mess by a person.
- To calculate the overall minimum time spent in the mess using mathematical equations.
- To create a generator to simulate the problem by assuming the three PDFs that were discussed in class.
- To use various statistical techniques and libraries to plot and analyze different aspects of the data.
